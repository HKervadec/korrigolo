Hello ! Thank you very much for using Glasir. We hope it will get you a fulfilling exeprience.

Glasir uses a existing software called ADTool: therefore, you need it to run Glasir. Glasir is provided with a functional jar file of ADTool, but you'll probably need to download JDK 6 or later if you don't have it to run ADTool correctly.

Please follow this link to download and install a working JDK for your Operating System: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Additionally ADTool depends on the following libraries: 
- TreeLayout, that you can find here: https://code.google.com/p/treelayout/ 
- InfoNodeDockingWindows, that you can find here: http://www.infonode.net/index.html?idw

When all those steps are done, please be sure that the jar file of ADTool is in the same folder that Glasir.exe. Then launch Glasir.exe, and enjoy !
