Hello ! Thank you very much for using Glasir. We hope it will get you a fulfilling exeprience.

Glasir uses a existing software called ADTool: therefore, you need it to run Glasir. Glasir is provided with a functional jar file of ADTool, but you'll probably need to download JDK 6 or later if you don't have it to run ADTool correctly.

Please follow this link to download and install a working JDK for your Operating System: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Additionally ADTool depends on the following libraries: 
- TreeLayout, that you can find here: https://code.google.com/p/treelayout/ 
- InfoNodeDockingWindows, that you can find here: http://www.infonode.net/index.html?idw

Please be sure that the jar file of ADTool is in the same folder that Glasir.exe.

You may have to associate .jar file with java. In this case, please follow these steps:
- Open Windows Explorer by right-clicking the Start button, and then click Explore.
- Click a folder that contains a .jar file (like ADTool.jar).
- Right-click the file and click Open With (or point to Open With, and then click Choose Program).
- In the Programs list, click Java (or click Browse, locate it, click it, and then click Open).
- Click to select the "Always use the selected program to open this kind of file" check box if it is not selected.
- Click OK.
If ADTool launch correctly after those steps, you can close it and then restart Glasir.

Finally, be sure that the ADTrees you want to work with don't have space(s) in their path, and that they have been exported from ADTool to XML with the option "Add derived value" checked. 

When all those steps are done, launch Glasir.exe, and enjoy !
